### Go Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture with Golang with Dependency Injection

### Use of Linter in the project

To install all the packages and run the linter in git pre-commit hook; Run

> Make lint-setup
> <br/>

### Run Migration Commands

> ⚓️ &nbsp; Add argument `p=host` after `make` if you want to run the migration runner from the host environment instead of docker environment. example; `make p=host migrate-up`

If you are not using docker; ensure that sql-migrate is installed to use migration from the host environment.
To install sql-migrate:

> go get -v github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate/...

### Run app with docker

-   Update database env variables with credentials defined in `docker-compose.yml`
-   Start server using command `docker-compose up -d` or `sudo docker-compose up -d` if permission issues
    > Assumes: Docker is already installed in the machine.

### Run app without docker

-   Run `go run main.go app:serve` to run app server.
-   There are other commands available as well. You can run `go run main.go -help` to know about other commands available.

## Testing

The framework comes with unit and integration testing support out of the box. You can check examples written in tests directory.
To run the test just run: `go test ./... -v`

### For test coverage

-   `go test ./... -v -coverprofile cover.txt -coverpkg=./...`
-   `go tool cover -html=cover.txt -o index.html`

## Checking API documents with swagger UI

Browse to `http://localhost:${SWAGGER_PORT}`

-   You can see all the documented endpoints in Swagger-UI from the API specification
-   You can execute/test endpoint
    You can read the article to know more on this: https://medium.com/wesionary-team/swagger-ui-on-docker-for-testing-rest-apis-5b3d5fcdee7

## Update Dependencies

<details>
    <summary><b>Steps to Update Dependencies</b></summary>
    
1. ```go get -u```
2. Remove all the dependencies packages that has ```// indirect``` from the modules
3. ```go mod tidy```
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Discovering available updates</b></summary>
    
List all of the modules that are dependencies of your current module, along with the latest version available for each:
> $ go list -m -u all

Display the latest version available for a specific module:

> $ go list -m -u example.com/theirmodule

<b>Example:</b>

> $ go list -m -u cloud.google.com/go/firestore<br/>
> cloud.google.com/go/firestore v1.2.0 [v1.6.1]

</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Getting a specific dependency version</b></summary>
    
To get a specific numbered version, append the module path with an @ sign followed by the version you want:
> $ go get example.com/theirmodule@v1.3.4

To get the latest version, append the module path with @latest:

> $ go get example.com/theirmodule@latest
